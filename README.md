# SpotKin

SpotKin is an intelligent monitoring application that transforms your ordinary devices into AI-powered guardians for babies, pets, and home environments. Unlike traditional monitors that simply relay raw video or sound, SpotKin understands what it sees, providing meaningful insights and alerts only when something truly matters.

## Vision & Mission

Our vision is to give every parent and caregiver true peace of mind through smart, caring eyes. We believe an ordinary smartphone can become an intelligent guardian, silently watching over babies, pets, and homes with the sensitivity and understanding of a trusted sitter.

Our mission is to transform off-the-shelf devices into AI-powered "nannies" that see and understand the scene, delivering only meaningful alerts and replacing frantic checking with calm confidence.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- A modern web browser (Chrome recommended for best PWA experience)

### Option 1: Running with a Local Web Server (Recommended)

The application uses Puter.js for AI image analysis, which requires the application to be served from a web server due to security restrictions with the `file://` protocol.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dseeker/spotkin.git
   cd spotkin
   ```

2. Install http-server globally (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   ```

3. Start the local web server:
   ```bash
   npm run start-app
   # or alternatively: http-server -p 8080
   ```

4. Open a browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   # or http://localhost:8080 if using http-server directly
   ```

5. **Install as PWA** (Optional):
   - Look for the install prompt in your browser
   - On mobile: Add to Home Screen from browser menu
   - Enable notifications in Settings for critical alerts

### Option 2: Opening the HTML File Directly

While opening the index.html file directly in a browser is possible, the Puter.js AI functionality and PWA features will not work due to security restrictions on the `file://` protocol. However, you can still see the UI and test the mock AI functionality:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. The application will detect that Puter.js is unavailable and activate the mock AI module
4. **Note**: PWA features (service worker, notifications, offline support) require HTTPS or localhost

npm run test:pwa

# Run Lighthouse PWA audit
npm run lighthouse:pwa

# Validate PWA implementation
npm run validate-manifest

# Generate PWA icons
npm run generate-icons
```

### Test Coverage
- **E2E Tests**: Comprehensive user workflow validation
- **PWA Tests**: Service worker, manifest, and installation testing
- **Performance Tests**: Lighthouse integration with automated scoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Puter.js Error: Unsupported Protocol**
   - **Symptom**: Error message stating "Puter.js Error: Unsupported Protocol"
   - **Cause**: Opening the application directly via the file:/// protocol
   - **Solution**: Serve the application through a web server using http-server as described above

2. **Camera Permission Issues**
   - **Symptom**: Camera fails to initialize or shows a black screen
   - **Cause**: Browser permissions not granted or blocked
   - **Solution**: Check browser settings and ensure camera permissions are allowed for the site

3. **AI Analysis Errors**
   - **Symptom**: AI analysis fails with error messages
   - **Cause**: Connection issues with Puter AI service or malformed requests
   - **Solution**: Ensure you're connected to the internet and try refreshing the page

4. **PWA Installation Issues**
   - **Symptom**: No install prompt appears or PWA features don't work
   - **Cause**: Running on file:// protocol or unsupported browser
   - **Solution**: Use localhost or HTTPS, ensure browser supports PWA features

5. **Notification Permission Denied**
   - **Symptom**: Notifications don't appear despite being enabled
   - **Cause**: Browser notifications blocked or unsupported
   - **Solution**: Check browser notification settings and allow notifications for the site

6. **Puppeteer Chrome Installation Issues**
   - **Symptom**: Error about "Could not find Chrome" when using Puppeteer
   - **Solution**: Install the specific Chrome version that Puppeteer requires:
     ```bash
     npx puppeteer browsers install chrome@131.0.6778.204
     ```
