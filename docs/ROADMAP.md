# SpotKin Development Roadmap

## 1. Strategic Objectives

Based on the PetSpot vision document, our primary objectives are:

- Transform ordinary devices into AI-powered monitors for babies and pets
- Provide meaningful, context-aware alerts that reduce anxiety and alert fatigue
- Emphasize privacy by processing data locally with minimal sharing
- Create a solution that works on existing devices without special hardware

## 2. Industry Trends & Consumer Insights

   - Add confidence scoring for detected events

2. **Alert Classification System**
   - Implement logic to categorize alerts by type and severity
   - Create visual indicators for different alert levels
   - Add notification sounds based on alert severity

3. **User Preferences**
   - Create a preferences panel for customization
   - Allow users to set which events trigger alerts
   - Implement alert threshold adjustments

4. **UI Enhancements**
   - Add a setup wizard for first-time users
   - Improve the camera view with monitoring zone selection
   - Create a more detailed timeline view with filtering

5. **Documentation**
   - Create user guide documentation
   - Add developer documentation for the codebase
   - Create contribution guidelines

### Technical Improvements

1. **Code Structure**
   - Refactor code to follow module pattern for better organization
   - Implement proper error handling throughout the application
   - Add comprehensive logging for debugging

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize camera handling and image processing
   - Improve local storage management for history data
   - Implement lazy loading for UI components

3. **Testing Framework**
   - Expand automated testing
   - Add unit tests for core functions
   - Implement integration tests for the UI

## 5. Coding Standards

### Style Guide

- Follow JavaScript ES6+ standards
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for all functions
- Keep functions small and focused on a single purpose

### Architecture Principles

- **Modular Design**: Separate concerns into distinct modules
- **Event-Driven**: Use event listeners for loose coupling
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure basic functionality works without advanced features
- **Responsive Design**: Support all screen sizes and orientations
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines for accessibility

### Security & Privacy

- Process all data locally when possible
- Use secure storage methods for sensitive data
- Implement proper permission handling
- Never upload images without explicit user consent
- Use secure connections for any external communications

## 6. Future Considerations

### Business Model Options

1. **Freemium Model**:
   - Basic monitoring features free
   - Advanced analysis and multi-device support as premium features

2. **Subscription Service**:
   - Monthly subscription for enhanced features
