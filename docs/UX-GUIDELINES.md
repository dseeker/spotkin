# SpotKin User Experience Guidelines

This document outlines key UX principles and design guidelines for the SpotKin application, focused on creating a calming, intuitive experience that reduces anxiety rather than increasing it.

## Core UX Principles

### 1. Reduce Anxiety, Don't Create It

The primary psychological goal of SpotKin is to reduce anxiety for parents and pet owners. Every design decision should be evaluated against this metric.

- **Careful Alert Design**: Alerts should be informative without being alarming. Use color, wording, and sound design that conveys urgency appropriately without triggering panic.
- **Contextual Information**: Always provide context with alerts - not just "motion detected" but "baby rolled over, still sleeping peacefully."
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Acknowledge when things are going well ("Baby sleeping soundly for 2 hours").
- **Proactive Reassurance**: Regularly confirm monitoring is active and working properly.

### 2. Privacy-First Design

Users should feel in control of their data and confident in the privacy of intimate home settings.

- **Transparent Processing**: Clear indicators when processing is happening and where (on-device vs. cloud).
- **Explicit Consent**: Get explicit permission before any data leaves the device.
- **Privacy Controls**: Easy-to-find settings for controlling what data is collected and stored.
- **Deletion Options**: Simple ways to delete history, snapshots, and other data.

### 3. Progressive Disclosure

Introduce complexity gradually to avoid overwhelming users.

- **Essential First**: Start with the most essential functions front and center.
- **Advanced Settings**: Tuck advanced options in accessible but not prominent locations.
- **Guided Setup**: Step-by-step setup process with sensible defaults.
- **Contextual Help**: Provide explanations and guidance when introducing new features.

### 4. Inclusive Design

Design for all types of users and households.

- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines for color contrast, text size, and keyboard navigation.
- **Diverse Representation**: Use inclusive language and imagery in the app.
- **Adaptability**: Support different monitoring scenarios (babies, pets, elderly, home security).
- **Language Support**: Plan for internationalization and localization.

## Visual Design Elements

### Color Palette

The color palette should evoke calm, trust, and security while providing clear information hierarchy.

- **Consistent Margins**: 16px (1rem) base spacing, with 8px (0.5rem) for tighter spaces
- **Responsive Breakpoints**:
  - Mobile: 0-640px
  - Tablet: 641-1024px
  - Desktop: 1025px+

## Interactive Elements

### Buttons

- **Secondary Button**: White background, indigo border and text
- **Tertiary/Text Button**: No background, indigo text
- **Danger Button**: Red background, white text
- **Button States**: Include hover, active, and disabled states with clear visual differences

### Input Controls

- **Toggles**: Clear on/off states with color indication
- **Sliders**: For adjusting thresholds or sensitivity settings
- **Dropdowns**: For selecting from a list of options with preview of currently selected item

### Alerts & Notifications

- **Toast Notifications**: For temporary success messages and non-critical updates
- **Modal Alerts**: For critical information requiring acknowledgment
- **In-Line Alerts**: For contextual warnings or information within the interface
- **Banner Alerts**: For system-wide notifications or persistent warnings

### Loading States

- **Initial Loading**: Branded splash screen with subtle animation
- **Content Loading**: Skeleton screens rather than spinner where possible
- **Processing Indicator**: Subtle animation for when AI processing is occurring
- **Progress Indication**: Clear progress bars for multi-step processes

## Key Screens & Components

### Camera View

- **Primary Focus**: The camera view should be large and clear
- **Overlay Elements**: Minimal and non-intrusive status indicators
- **Controls**: Easily accessible but not obstructing the view
- **Monitoring Zones**: Visible when configured but subtle during monitoring

### Analysis Results

- **Scene Description**: Natural language description in conversational tone
- **Object Detection**: Clear visualization of detected objects
- **Confidence Levels**: Visual indication of AI confidence in detections
- **Alert Status**: Prominent but not anxiety-inducing

### Timeline & History

- **Chronological Organization**: Clear timestamps and date grouping
- **Event Categorization**: Visual distinction between different types of events
- **Filtering Controls**: Easy way to filter by event type, time, or significance
- **Thumbnail Previews**: Small visual indicators for events where appropriate

### Settings & Preferences

- **Logically Grouped**: Settings organized in intuitive categories
- **Explanatory Text**: Brief explanations of what each setting controls
- **Default Values**: Sensible defaults clearly indicated
- **Preview Effects**: Where possible, show the effect of settings changes

## Micro-Interactions & Animations

- **Purpose-Driven**: Animations should serve a purpose (guide attention, show status)
- **Subtle & Swift**: Avoid flashy or lengthy animations that could distract
- **Consistent Timing**: Use consistent timing curves for similar interactions
- **Reduced Motion Option**: Respect user preferences for reduced motion

## Content Guidelines

### Tone & Voice

- **Calm & Reassuring**: Text should have a calming effect, especially for alerts
- **Clear & Direct**: Avoid jargon or technical terms when possible
- **Conversational**: Use natural language rather than technical descriptions
- **Encouraging**: Positive reinforcement rather than alarmist language

### Alert Phrasing
