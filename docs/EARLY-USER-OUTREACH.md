# SpotKin Early User Outreach - Simple & Effective

Since SpotKin is **free and already live**, our goal is to get 50 early users to try it and share feedback.

## 🎯 Simple 3-Step Strategy

### Step 1: Direct Social Media Posts (Week 1)
Post in relevant communities with simple message:
> "Hey! I built a free pet monitoring tool that works instantly in your browser (no downloads). Would love 2 minutes of feedback if anyone wants to try it: [link]"

**Target Communities:**
- r/dogs, r/petsitting, r/puppy101
- Facebook pet owner groups
- Twitter #pettech #petsitting hashtags

### Step 2: Personal Network (Week 1-2)
Reach out to friends/family who are:
- Pet owners
- Parents
- Anyone who might need monitoring

**Simple ask:** "Could you try my pet monitoring tool for 2 minutes and tell me what you think?"

### Step 3: Follow Up & Track (Ongoing)
- Track who tries it (Google Analytics)
- Send follow-up email asking for feedback
- Ask satisfied users to share with friends

## 📱 Ready-to-Use Social Posts

### Reddit r/dogs
```
Title: Built a free pet monitoring tool - 2 min feedback?

Hey r/dogs! I'm a fellow dog parent who built a monitoring tool that works instantly in any browser. No downloads, no signup - just open and start monitoring.

Perfect for when someone's watching your pup or you're stepping out quickly.

Would love 2 minutes of feedback from other dog parents: https://dseeker.github.io/spotkin/

What works? What's confusing? Worth using?

Thanks! 🐕

### Email Follow-Up (1 week after first visit)
