# SpotKin Voice Alerts Setup Guide

Voice alerts are SpotKin's signature feature - spoken notifications that tell you exactly what's happening when you can't watch the screen. This guide will help you set up and optimize voice alerts for the best monitoring experience.

## üîä Quick Setup (30 seconds)

1. **Open SpotKin** in your browser
2. **Allow microphone access** when prompted (required for voice alerts)
3. **Test your volume** - voice alerts will play at your current system volume
4. **Start monitoring** - voice alerts automatically activate when motion is detected

That's it! Voice alerts work immediately with no additional setup required.

## üéØ Why Voice Alerts Matter

Traditional monitoring requires you to constantly watch a screen. SpotKin's voice alerts let you:
- **Multitask freely** - cook, clean, work while staying informed
- **Respond instantly** - know immediately when attention is needed
- **Stay relaxed** - no screen-watching anxiety, just clear spoken updates

## üõ†Ô∏è Detailed Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Browser Permissions

When you first open SpotKin, your browser will ask for microphone permission:

**Chrome/Edge:**
- Click "Allow" in the permission popup
- If you accidentally clicked "Block", click the üîí lock icon in address bar ‚Üí Site settings ‚Üí Microphone ‚Üí Allow

**Firefox:**
- Click "Allow" in the permission bar
- If blocked: Click shield icon in address bar ‚Üí Permissions ‚Üí Microphone ‚Üí Allow

**Safari:**
- Click "Allow" when prompted
- If blocked: Safari menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Websites ‚Üí Microphone ‚Üí Allow for SpotKin

> **Why microphone access?** SpotKin uses your device's speech synthesis (text-to-speech) which requires microphone permission in most browsers for security reasons. No audio is recorded or transmitted.

### Step 2: Volume & Audio Settings

**System Volume:**
- Set your device volume to 50-70% for clear voice alerts
- Voice alerts respect your system volume level
- Test with a voice alert to find your preferred level

**Headphones vs Speakers:**
- **Speakers recommended** - you'll hear alerts from anywhere in the room
- **Headphones work** but you need to keep them on
- **Bluetooth speakers** - perfect for whole-room coverage

**Audio Output Device:**
- Voice alerts use your default audio device
- Change in system settings if you want alerts on specific speakers
- Test voice alerts after changing audio devices

### Step 3: Voice Settings Customization

SpotKin offers several voice customization options:

**Voice Speed:**
- Default: Normal speed for clear understanding
- Fast: Quick alerts for experienced users
- Slow: Clearer pronunciation for noisy environments

**Voice Type:**
- Uses your system's default voice
- Windows: Change in Settings ‚Üí Time & Language ‚Üí Speech
- Mac: Change in System Preferences ‚Üí Accessibility ‚Üí Speech
- Mobile: Usually follows system language settings

**Alert Frequency:**
- Immediate: Alert on every detection (default)
- Throttled: Maximum one alert per 30 seconds
- Critical only: Only major movement changes

### Step 4: Testing Your Setup

**Quick Test:**
1. Start monitoring mode
2. Wave your hand in front of the camera
3. Listen for "Motion detected in monitoring zone"
4. Adjust volume if needed

**Full Test Scenario:**
1. Set up monitoring for a pet or room
2. Leave and return to trigger alerts
3. Verify you can hear alerts from intended distance
4. Test in your actual use environment (kitchen, office, etc.)

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### No Voice Alerts Playing

**Check Microphone Permission:**
- Look for microphone icon in browser address bar
- Ensure it shows "allowed" not "blocked"
- Refresh page after changing permissions

**Check System Audio:**
- Verify system volume is not muted
- Test other audio (YouTube, music) to confirm speakers work
- Try different audio output device

**Browser-Specific Issues:**
- **Chrome:** Clear site data and re-grant permissions
- **Firefox:** Check about:preferences#privacy for blocked sites
- **Safari:** Check if "Prevent cross-site tracking" is interfering

### Voice Alerts Too Quiet/Loud

**Volume Solutions:**
- Adjust system volume (affects all SpotKin audio)
- Move closer to speakers if using built-in laptop speakers
- Use external speakers for better room coverage
- Check if audio is routing to wrong device (headphones vs speakers)

### Voice Alerts Cut Off or Unclear

**Speech Synthesis Issues:**
- Some browsers load voice engines slowly on first use
- Wait 10-15 seconds after opening SpotKin before testing
- Try refreshing the page if voice sounds robotic
- Switch to different voice in system settings

### Alerts in Wrong Language

**Language Settings:**
- Voice alerts use your browser's language setting
- Change browser language: Settings ‚Üí Languages
- System voice language: varies by operating system
- Refresh SpotKin after changing language settings

## üì± Mobile Device Setup

### iPhone/iPad Setup

1. **Safari Settings:**
   - Settings ‚Üí Safari ‚Üí Camera & Microphone Access ‚Üí Allow
   - Ensure "Request Desktop Website" is OFF for SpotKin

2. **Volume Considerations:**
   - Use physical volume buttons to adjust
   - Check Ring/Silent switch position
   - Voice alerts respect "Do Not Disturb" settings

3. **Background Usage:**
   - Keep Safari tab active for continuous alerts
   - Add SpotKin to home screen for app-like experience

### Android Setup

1. **Chrome Permissions:**
   - Site settings ‚Üí Microphone ‚Üí Allow
   - Notifications ‚Üí Allow (for voice alert prompts)

2. **Volume Setup:**
   - Use volume rocker for media volume
   - Voice alerts use "Media" volume, not "Ring" volume
   - Test alerts after adjusting

3. **Battery Optimization:**
   - Exclude Chrome from battery optimization
   - Keep screen on or use "Stay awake" developer option
