*How to keep an eye on your pets while away using modern technology*

## üè† Why Pet Parents Need Monitoring Solutions

### The Modern Pet Parent Dilemma

Today's pet parents face unique challenges that previous generations didn't experience:

**Lifestyle Changes:**
- Longer work days and commutes

- 65% check on pets during work days when possible
- 45% have cut short trips due to pet-related concerns
- 92% want real-time updates about their pet's wellbeing

**Traditional Solutions Fall Short:**

## üêï Pet-Specific Monitoring Strategies
